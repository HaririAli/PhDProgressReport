\begin{abstract}
	This report describes the progress and plan our research on state and session management in the \acrfull{ucon} model.
	We describe the state of the art and outline research problems and our corresponding objectives.
	We categorise our objectives as foundational and architectural, where foundational objectives aim at addressing fundamental issues at the model level while architectural objectives aim at solving framework and use-case problems.
	The outcome of our research includes an extension of the state model of \acrshort{ucon} in order to accommodate emerging use-cases (e.g. data flow control) that could not be originally support in \acrshort{ucon}.
	The outcome also includes a generalised Session-Based \acrfull{abac} model.
	This generalisation is still a work in progress and will be completed soon.
	Moreover, we use the foundations of \acrshort{ucon} (i.e., policy-based evaluation and continuous monitoring) as the building blocks for continuous and context-aware identity and privilege management system.
	Finally, we propose a clustering solution for \gls{ucon} in cloud and enterprise environments.
