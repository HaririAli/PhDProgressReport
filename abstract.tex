\begin{abstract}
	This report describes the progress and plan of our research on state and session management in the \acrfull{ucon} model.
	We describe the state of the art and outline research problems and our corresponding objectives.
	We categorise our objectives as foundational and architectural, where foundational objectives aim at addressing fundamental issues at the model level while architectural objectives aim at solving framework and use-case problems.
	Our foundational objectives include extending the state model of \acrshort{ucon} in order to accommodate emerging use-cases (e.g. data flow control) that could not be originally supported in \acrshort{ucon}.
	The main goal of our research is proposing a generalised Session-Based \acrfull{abac} model that can cover \gls{ucon} as well as emerging use-cases relating to continuous authorisation.
	Moreover, we use the foundations of \acrshort{ucon} (i.e., policy-based evaluation and continuous monitoring) as the building blocks for continuous and context-aware identity and privilege management.
	Finally, we propose a clustering solution for \gls{ucon} in cloud and enterprise environments.
