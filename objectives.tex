\section{Research Challenges and Objectives}\label{sec:objectives}
In this section we describe our research objectives, which intend to address session management issues in \gls{ucon}.
We are particularly interested in the \acrshort{ucsp}, so our work is based on this particular implementation of \gls{ucon}.
We categorise our objectives as foundational and architectural, where foundational objectives aim at addressing fundamental issues at the model level, while the purpose of the architectural objectives is to solve framework problems as well as use-cases.

\subsection{Foundational}\label{sec:foundational}
\subsubsection{Continuity of \(pre\) and \(post\) Phases}
As described in Section \ref{sec:state_model}, our team added continuity to the \(pre\) and \(post\) phases by adding an internal counter of re-evaluations and by keeping the session alive as long as the decision is not \(deny\) and as long as the counter is below a defined threshold
We argue that this was an engineering solution addressing a fundamental issue that must be solved at a model level.

Firstly, in order to add continuity to the \(pre\) and \(post\) phases, the policies have to be intentionally written in a way that results in an \(indeterminate\) decision as long as the counter has not expired.
This causes a security risk because an the policy language standard does not define how the \(indeterminate\) decision should be treated and leaves such decision to the enforcement point.
For this reason, we argue that the continuity of these phases must be enabled even when access is denied.

Secondly, the counter was added to allow re-evaluations of specific attributes or changes such as trust level or user behaviour.
However, the counter may expire due to updates of other attributes before capturing the changes of interest (e.g. behavioural changes).
This is likely to happen in inconstant environments such as \gls{iot} or \gls{iov} where attribute values change frequently.
Therefore, we intend to support this continuity in the state model itself.
