\section{Background and Research Problems}\label{sec:background}
This section describes the state of the art and outline the research problems that need to be addressed.

\subsection{\acrfull{ucon} Model}
The \gls{ucon} model was proposed by Park and Sandhu \cite{ucon} as generalisation of access control that covers authorisations, obligations and conditions, and grants or denies access based on attributes.
Authorisations are functional predicates over subject and object attributes, and must be satisfied to grant access rights; Obligations are mandatory actions that must be fulfilled in order to grant access rights; and Conditions are environmental or situational requirements that must be met to grant access rights.
The main novelty of \gls{ucon} is that it extends access control with mutability of attributes and continuity of control.
Unlike preceding models, \gls{ucon} assumes that attribute values may change during authorisations.
For this reason, \gls{ucon} specifies that authorisations, obligations and conditions must be evaluated before access starts, while access is in progress, and after access ends, which adds continuity of control.
Therefore, if an attribute value changes while access is in progress, and the security policy is not satisfied anymore, \gls{ucon} revokes the granted authorisation.





% UCON introduced by Sandhu as extension with continuity and mutability
% the model was intended for DRM but it can cover a wide variety of use-cases
% Fabio proposed an architecture and policy language for UCON
% CNR applied UCON in multiple use-cases
% Dimitrakos extended the pre state by adding a counter but this is a hack because counter can expire before the intended objective
% The pre and post states must be extended on the model level
% there is no problem with them having a long lifetime on the model level. This is implementation detail.
% Multiple state models may be needed. 
% The three phases are not enough and there may be more phases.
% Classifying policies by phases is actually unnecessary.
% Decision does not necessarily have an effect on the state and no need to re-evaluate.
% UCON lacks formalism in the sense that it is
